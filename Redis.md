== Single Redis Instance

Note: Redis is not supported on Windows

Using my local Linux server, went to Portainer and created a first instance of Redis using Docker (refers to https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/docker/).

Deployed redis/redis-stack-server:latest
